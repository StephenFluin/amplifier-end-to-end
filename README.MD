# Dependencies

- Python 3
- Docker (running)
- `requests` python library
- `axelard` in your path

## Python

You'll need python and `requests` installed on your machine. You can download python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once you have python installed, you can install pip by following the instructions [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

To install request on mac:

```bash
brew install python-request
```

or with `pip`

```bash
python3 -m pip install requests
```

You may need to turn on the Docker daemon (run docker desktop?)

Now run the script

```bash
python3 main.py
```
